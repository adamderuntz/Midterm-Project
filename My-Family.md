##My Family

I grew up in a family of 5. I have one older brother, Erik, and an older sister, Kalee. My mom is named Charlotte, and my dads name is Scott. I have two dogs, Oreo and Brady! My older brother is 21 years old, and my older sister is 35 years old. This leaves me as the youngest at 18 years old. 

**Second Family**

My best friends family is another family that has a huge impact on my life. They act as my second family. That includes my second parents, Mark and Rachel, and my best friend Ethan and his sister Aubrey. I am always at their house and enjoy spending time with them.
